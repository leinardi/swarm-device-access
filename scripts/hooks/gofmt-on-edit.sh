# gofmt-on-edit.sh -- Claude Code PostToolUse hook (configured in .claude/settings.json).
# Auto-formats Go files immediately after an Edit/Write tool call so formatting
# drift is fixed at edit time instead of failing later at pre-commit.
#
# Input: hook payload JSON on stdin; the edited path is at .tool_input.file_path.
# Always exits 0 (a formatting fix must never block the agent).
